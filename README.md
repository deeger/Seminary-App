#Seminary-App

### This application is for Seminary teachers to take attendance quickly at the beginning of class.

######Teachers will first pick the class they want to mark attendance for. Quickly navigate to other classes with the *class dropdown* at the top of the page.

Once in a class a teacher can navigate to days within that class and mark attendance for each individual student as well as changing all unmarked students to either present or absent (once all student have been marked the mark all feature wont change anything). Teachers can also toggle pictures on and off.
